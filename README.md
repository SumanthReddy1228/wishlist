# Wishlist

A tiny React wishlist app where you can add items, mark them completed, and delete them. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Features

- Add wishlist items
- Mark items as completed
- Delete items
- Each item uses a UUID for stable keys (`uuid` package)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (16+ recommended) and npm or a compatible package manager (yarn, pnpm)

## Install

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
```

If you haven't installed the runtime dependency used by the app (UUID):

```bash
# npm
npm install uuid
